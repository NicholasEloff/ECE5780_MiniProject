# High-Level Description
This project's goal was to convert an average off the shelf remote control car and convert it to a gyroscopic controled car. 
This was accomplished by interfacing our STM32 board to the transmitter from the remote. We first attempted to interface with
the motors of the car but we were not able to provide enough current to run them. We then tried to use the circuit board of the
car itself and this proved to be futile. After discussions and ideas from our TA we were able to interface with the board of the
transmitter. We accomplished this by soldering wires onto each of the leads (left,right,forward,backward). We also soldered a 
wire that acted as ground.

The next task was making sure that the STM32 board would be able output the correct voltage that we needed. As we were using
the oscilloscope we found that the transmitter board would need an input of 5V, the 3.3 was not sufficient to run it. After a 
little bit of research we found that there are certain pins on the STM32 that output 5V. All we needed to do was add a couple of 
pull up resistors and enable the pins.

The longest and most tedious part of this project was getting our gyroscope code to work. We had some previous code that was 
mostly working but it took a lot of time for us to figure it out. The code was flashing the LED's constantly and as soon as we
took out the code that toggled them, everything would break. Carter suggested we just turn the LED's off rather than comment out
the code and this solved our problem. We also encountered a problem that the gyroscope would desync very quickly and we had to 
add some code to rectify this. After this problem was solved we needed to hook the gyroscope to the 5v pins that were wired to
the transmitter leads. This proved to be challenging in making this work. Beverly was the MVP when it came to figuring out the gyroscope
code. She was able to figure out the bugs that were in the orginal code and hook everything up to the car. She spent multiple hours
debugging and trying new things to get it to work.

In the end we were able to accomplish our original goal of making a car that was controlled by hand movements with data coming
from the gyroscope. It was a fun, frustrating, and good project to learn from.
